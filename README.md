This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Development

**As this project uses **PNPM** make sure you have it installed:**

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

After that, use pnpm instead of npm as you would usually.

---

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

**Populate database info:**

1. Copy and Paste the `.env.local.template` naming it `.env.local`
2. Fill in the data

---

**Lastly, run the development server:**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
